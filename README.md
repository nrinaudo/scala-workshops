# Purpose

This repository stores a series of Scala workshops I'm giving at work.


# Conventions

## _MCQ_

Multiple choice questions:
* ask the question
* get attendants to vote on their answer
* if at least one person fails to give the right answer, get attendants to explain their votes to each other
* conduct another vote
* if at least one person fails to give the right answer, explain

## Exercise

* Pair programmed
* Try to pair disparate levels together, so that the more experienced can guide the least experienced
* Swap the "writer" and the "talker" for every exercise
